These files were copied here from https://github.com/EnTeQuAk/markey which is a
project by the same original owner as the project this repo was forked from
(django-babel-underscore).

The original project hasn't had updates in 8 years and while a PR was made to
make the same fix upstream (https://github.com/EnTeQuAk/markey/pull/6) we can't
wait for it to get merged before the Redwood release cut (May 2024).

To reduce the number of forks we have in play for frontend tech that we have
already deprecated, we copy the bits we need here and make the updates we need
to get support for Python 3.11 and 3.12. The content was copied from https://github.com/EnTeQuAk/markey/commit/d9fc042b147824164908f00a24da6ce2c26dcd8e before we added modifications to allow for Python 3.11 support.
